# Voting System for Group Decision

## Project Description

The Voting System for Group Decision is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables transparent and secure group decision-making processes. This smart contract allows any user to create voting polls with simple yes/no questions and enables community members to cast their votes in a trustless manner. The system ensures vote integrity by preventing double voting and maintaining a transparent record of all votes cast.

The contract implements a straightforward voting mechanism where poll creators can propose questions or decisions, and participants can vote either "yes" or "no" on the proposal. All voting data is stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering with results.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize decision-making processes by providing a decentralized, transparent, and accessible voting platform. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized authorities in group decisions, reduce voting fraud, and increase participation in democratic processes. By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a future where every vote is counted, verified, and permanently recorded, fostering trust and transparency in collective decision-making.

The platform strives to bridge the gap between traditional voting systems and modern blockchain technology, making it easier for communities, organizations, and groups of any size to conduct fair and transparent polls.
